C Programs for Numerical Computing

These programs are made for educational purposes only as part of an upcoming textbook that the author is working on. 
You may use them for your own personal learning.

The files "matrixOps.c" and "matrixOps.h" form a library of linear algebra functions including:
- Matrix arithmetic
- Determinants
- Cofactor matrices
- Matrix inversion
- Solution to linear systems by inversion

To see how these are implemented, consult "LSA_linear.c" or "LSA_quad.c" which apply this library for
Least-Squares Analysis (linear regression) using straight line and quadratic fits respectively.
